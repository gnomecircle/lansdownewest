        paragraph1: 'Even now I can still picture my mother sitting at the desk in my bedroom, reading by the glow of the desk lamp, while I lay snuggled in my bed supposedly falling asleep but fighting to stay awake to hear one more page. The gift of reading was given to me young and stayed with me through my teens into adulthood. In this age of technology where devices have stilled communication, reading is more relevant than ever.  Today students lack vocabulary and writing skills. Reading together is a wonderful bonding experience.',
        paragraph2: 'Many years ago, as a new teacher, I attended a conference.  The speaker closed his lecture with the advice that if any subject had to be omitted during the course of a school day, never to omit reading to your class on a daily basis – no matter the age group. I am proud to write that I never faltered in this advice and hope that I fostered a love of reading in my students.  No kindle, nook or other reading device can compare to feeling the pages of a book. A love of reading is one of the greatest gifts you can give a child – it lasts a lifetime.',
